> In this project you will have to create a system file explorer that allows the user to navigate, create directories and upload files in the same way as he would in his usual operating system.

> The file explorer is a tool that allows you to directly view and manipulate the files and directories associated with a path, so you must take into account from which path the user starts and which path they can access.
